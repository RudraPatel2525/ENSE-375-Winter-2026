## 2.0 Design Problem

### 2.1 Problem Definition
This project is defined as the design, development, and comprehensive testing of a playlist generator. The application will generate music playlists based on the users preferences and inputs like mood, time of day, age restrictions, genre, etc. It will use rules and states machines to ensure predictable behaviour, consistent outcomes, and high testability. The focus of the project will not be the UI or the complexity and "taste" of the recommendations themselves but rather the design and implementation of an automated, rule-based system with well defined logic, state machines, and clear constraints. This allows us to apply a wide range of software testing and validation techniques.

### 2.2 Design Requirements

### 2.2.1 Functions
The primary function of the Playlist Generator are as follows...
- Accept user input for playlist criteria, including genre, mood, explicit/non-explicit, max playlist size, max playlist duration
- Read song data and song attributes from a text file
- Filter songs based on user-defined playlist criteria
- Use a seeded "shuffle" to generate a playlist
- Detect and handle cases where insufficient valid songs exist to generate a playlist
- Display the generated playlist, without saving

### 2.2.2 Objectives
The primary motivation for this project is to practice and demonstrate rigorous software testing and validation techniques in a controlled, realistic setting. The project is intentionally designed to emphasize deterministic, testable logic over UI complexity or data persistence.
Specifically, this project aims to:
- Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) throughout the development lifecycle.
- Use a state-machine–based design to support required testing methods such as state transition testing.
- Implement a discrete, rule-based system to ensure deterministic behavior and verifiable outcomes.
- Maintain a realistic yet manageable scope suitable for comprehensive verification.
- Prioritize core logic and backend behavior over UI and database implementation to focus on testing quality rather than presentation.

To achieve these objectives, the project will:
- Develop a testable MVC architecture, ensuring modularity and separation of concerns to support TDD.
- Implement comprehensive testing suites, including:
    - Unit and Path Testing to verify internal logic and control flow.
    - Black-Box Testing, applying boundary value analysis and equivalence class testing to user inputs (e.g., age, mood, genre).
    - State Transition Testing to verify correct transitions between system states (e.g., Selection → Generation → Error).
- Ensure deterministic system behavior, enabling reliable automation and repeatable test results.
- Address regulatory and ethical design constraints, such as enforcing age-based restrictions.
- Maintain strict requirement-to-test traceability through a traceability matrix that links each requirement to one or more test cases (Features without explicit requirements will not be implemented).
- Use a minimalist UI/interface to keep focus on validation, verification, and system behavior rather than aesthetics.

### 2.2.3 Constraints
| Constraint Category | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| UI / Interface | The application will use a simple, minimalist interface (text-based or basic GUI). UI design prioritizes functionality and testability over aesthetics. No advanced frontend frameworks or UI-heavy features will be used. |
| Regulatory Compliance (Security & Access) | Age restrictions must be strictly enforced based on user input. The system must comply with basic data protection principles and must not store any personally identifiable information (PII) such as real names, emails, or listening history. |
| Reliability & Determinism | Given identical inputs (e.g., Mood: Happy, Time: Morning), the state machine must traverse the exact same sequence of states and produce identical playlist rules and outputs every time. |
| Input Constraints | User inputs must be restricted to a fixed, predefined set, including mood, explicit/non-explicit preference, genre, playlist size, and playlist duration. |
| Data Constraints | The system must operate on a static or predefined dataset of music metadata (e.g., genre, mood tags, age ratings) and must not rely on live streaming services or external APIs. |
| Architecture & Testability | The system must be designed using a modular MVC architecture to support Test Driven Development (TDD), comprehensive testing, and deterministic verification. |
| Version Control | Git must be used for version control throughout the entire development process. |
| Economic Constraints | The application must be developed using open-source tools and libraries only, with no paid APIs or licensing costs. Deployment must be possible on a low-cost hosting platform or via self-hosting, with scalability to moderate traffic. |
| Societal & Ethical Considerations | The application must be inclusive and neutral, avoiding cultural, gender, or demographic bias in playlist generation logic and rule definitions. |

## 3.0 Solution
In this section, you will provide an account of some solutions your team brainstormed to implement and test the project. Some solutions might not have all the desired features, some might not satisfy the constraints, or both. These solutions come up in your mind while you brainstorm ways of implementing all the features while meeting the constraints. Towards, the end you select a solution that you think has all the features, testable and satisfies all the constraints. Remember that an engineering design is iterative in nature! 
### 3.1	Solution 1: Dynamic Web App with External APIs
Description:
This solution proposed a web-based application featuring a dynamic user interface. Instead of using a static local dataset, this version would utilize external APIs for retrieving song data and leverage a generative AI model (OpenAI) to create the playlists. The goal was to create a highly engaging user experience with a modern feature set.
### 3.2	Solution 2
This is an improved solution but might not be the final solution that you select. Give a brief description of this solution here. Again focus on its testing attributes. 

### 3.3	Final Solution
This is the final solution.  Explain why it is better than other solutions (focus more on testing). You may use a table for comparison purposes. After providing the reason for selecting this solution, detail it below.

### 3.3.1	Components
What components you used in the solution? What is the main purpose of using individual component? What testing method did you employ for each component? Provide a block diagram (with a numbered caption, such as Fig. 1) representing the connectivity and interaction between all the components.

### 3.3.2	Environmental, Societal, Safety, and Economic Considerations
Explain how your engineering design took into account environmental, societal, economic and other constraints into consideration. It may include how your design has positive contributions to the environment and society? What type of economic decisions you made? How did you make sure that the design is reliable and safe to use? 

### 3.3.3	Test Cases and results
What test suits did you design to test your prototype? How did you execute the test cases to test the prototype?

### 3.3.4	Limitations
Every product has some limitations, and so is the case with your design product. Highlight some of the limitations of your solution here.
