## 2.0 Design Problem

### 2.1 Problem Definition
This project is defined as the design, development, and comprehensive testing of a playlist generator. The application will generate music playlists based on the users preferences and inputs like mood, time of day, age restricitions, genre, etc. It will use rules and states machines to ensure predictible behaviour, consistent outcomes, and high testability. The focus of the project will not be the UI or the complexity and "taste" of the recommendations themselves but rather the design and implementation of an automated, rule-based system with well defined logic, state machines, and clear constraints. This allows us to apply a wide range of software testing and validation techniques.
